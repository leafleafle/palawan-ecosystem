                    <p class="prev-post-text">With many species being driven to the point of near extinction due to humanity’s activities, Palawan’s future looks incredibly bleak. However, not all hope is lost. There are many solutions and initiatives already in place, but how effective are they?Under the Strategic Environmental Plan (SEP) for Palawan Act (RA 7611 of 1992), the Environmentally Critical Areas Network (ECAN) framework was established and enacted, classifying areas into zones with graded protection.

These concerning trends are driven by various, avoidable manmade activities. Deforestation, agricultural expansion, and urbanization lead to the killing and fragmenting of habitats. Many species are displaced from their homes....</p>
