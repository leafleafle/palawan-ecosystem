                <p>Biodiversity is the burst of color that paints nature’s endless expanse of forest and seas with life and vigor. As populations rise, forests felled, buildings erected, and natural ecosystems replaced by automated agricultural farms, our country slowly loses its color. Palawan, largely acknowledged as the Philippines’ last ecological frontier for biodiversity, is at risk of losing its color as well. Imagine Palawan devoid of the Peacock Pheasant’s elegant blue feathers, the forests robbed of Calamian deers roaming and the grasslands of the gentle Palawan Pangolins foraging around for food. Imagine no longer seeing Palawan’s majestic mangroves and all the beautiful species it houses. Seeing only gray, lifeless corals on Palawan’s seabed when going out for a dive. It’s both a saddening, terrifying, yet very feasible thought. Especially if no action is taken, and we let Palawan crumble to ruin.</p>
                <br>
                <p>As an advocacy page, PalawanEco hopes that this problem reaches the hearts of those willing to support Palawan’s biodiversity in any way possible. Be it a small donation, choosing ecotours, or simply spreading the word to protect Palawan’s biodiversity, any aid counts.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Other than spreading awareness, how exactly can we help? Many initiatives from local organizations are in place. Donating to the following organizations can help them continue their operations:</p>
                <br>
                <ul>

Established the <a target="_blank" class="a-highlight" href="https://katalafoundation.org/ki/">Katala Institute of Ecology and Biodiversity Conservation (KIEBC)</a> and conducted the <a target="_blank" class="a-highlight" href="https://www.philippinecockatoo.org/programs%20and%20strategies.htm#KATALA%20Quest">Katala Quest</a>, an extensive research initiative through the form of an expedition and scientific field study.</li>
                            <li>Hosted the <a target="_blank" class="a-highlight" href="https://katalafoundation.org/pccp/philippine-cockatoo-conservation-program/">Philippine Cockatoo Conservation Programme (PCCP)</a> with a poachers-to-wardens scheme that effectively increased the cockatoo population from around 20 in 1998 to over 200 today.</li>
                            <li>They have other initiatives that focuses on other species, like the <a target="_blank" class="a-highlight" href="https://katalafoundation.org/pftcp/philippine-freshwater-turtle-conservation-program/">Palawan Forest Turtle Conservation Program (PFTCP)</a> and the <a target="_blank" class="a-highlight" href="https://katalafoundation.org/pftcp/palawan-pangolin-conservation-program/">Palawan Pangolin Conservation Program (PPCP)</a></li>
                            <li>They also have programs like “Adopt an Animal” where the donor can fund the food, care, and safety of an endangered animal, and “Plant a Tree” where donations go to the maintenance of native tree seedlings for habitat restoration.</li>

Local volunteers were also trained to monitor beaches and how to protect turtle nests. Ex-situ hatcheries were also established to allow for safer egg hatching away from predators and poachers. Clean-up drives for plastic reduction were also conducted along west coast of Puerto Prinsesa City.</li>

                <p>For those interested in visiting Palawan for a tour, supporting tours implementing ecotourism and Community-Based Sustainable Tourism (CBST) goes a long way. CBST implementation is beneficial to both the environment and local residents, since residents are rewarded for taking care of the environment. Example tours that implement this include:</p>
                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Puerto Princesa Underground River Tour. Strict daily visitor limits and fees are enforced to minimize human impact on the cave system. The fees and regulated tourism directly fund the conservation and protection of the Subterranean River National Park, which is home to unique cave fauna, the endemic Palawan hornbill, and other rare wildlife in the surrounding forest.

                        Dewil Eco-Mangrove Tour in El Nido. Managed by the Dewil Eco-Mangrove Association (DEMA), this tour empowers the local community to protect a vital 412-hectare mangrove forest. Mangrove forests are crucial nurseries for marine life, protect coastlines from erosion, and serve as a massive carbon sink. The revenue from the tour provides an alternative, sustainable livelihood for locals, discouraging destructive practices like illegal mangrove cutting. The community also organizes mangrove-planting activities.

                        Tubbataha Reefs Natural Park in Cagayancillo. Tourism here is strictly regulated (primarily via liveaboard diving trips) and limited to a short season. The entry fees and controlled access directly fund the park's protection, which conserves around 360 species of coral and nearly 700 species of fish, including sharks, turtles, and manta rays, making it one of the most biodiverse marine ecosystems on Earth.

                        Iwahig River Cruise and Firefly Watching in Puerto Prinsesa City. The entire enterprise is structured around preserving the ecological integrity of the mangrove habitat, which is vital for the fireflies—a key bio-indicator requiring exceptionally clean air and water to thrive. Ecotourism principles are strictly followed by using quiet, paddle-operated boats to eliminate noise and water pollution, and by enforcing rules against bright lights and flash photography to avoid disrupting the fireflies' natural mating signals.

                The news of gradual loss of biodiversity and color in Palawan may be disheartening, however, not all hope is lost. There are a lot of organizations with initiatives that are fighting to repaint and restore Palawan's lost colors. If all of us help in Palawan's fight, whether we donate, volunteer, partake in ecotourism, or spread awareness, we can help preserve biodiversity in Palawan. The fate of Palawan collectively rests in our hands.
